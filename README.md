# TypeScript Playground

This project is a starter template for running a simple TypeScript Console application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project folder to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/ts-playground
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

- Create or edit your TypeScript file in the `root` folder.

- To run your TypeScript file, use the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will compile and execute the `index.ts` file using `ts-node`.

- To only compile TypeScript files, use the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will compile TypeScript files to JavaScript and place the output in the `dist` folder.

## TypeScript Configuration

You can customize the TypeScript settings for the project in the `tsconfig.json` file. This file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration.
